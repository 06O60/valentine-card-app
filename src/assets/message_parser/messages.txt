Are you sure?
Really sure?
Oh, I get it. You're playing hard to get!

Oh, silly! Did you accidentally click 'No'? It's okay, I forgive you! Just remember to click 'Yes' next time!
Hehe, you're such a tease, clicking 'No' like that! But I know deep down you're just playing hard to get.
Oh my gosh, did you really click 'No'? You're just too precious! Let's try again, shall we?
Oopsie! Looks like you accidentally clicked 'No'. But that's okay, I'll just smother you with hugs until you can't resist anymore!

Monica-3rd-wall
Wow, rejected by a button. That stings...
Oh, you're clicking 'No' again? You do realize I can see everything you do, right?
Don't you find it amusing, how you think you have control over your choices? It's all predetermined...
Clicking 'No' won't break free from the script. It's all part of the narrative, my dear player

404: Love not found. Error.
\"Error: Cannot read property 'heart' of undefined at NullPointer.heart(NullPointer.js)\"
I'm stuck in an infinite loop of rejection...
Did my love for you trigger a segmentation fault?

End
Oh, you clicked 'No' once again? I guess I'll just delete that option then...
